This project is a Power BI dashboard built using a Zepto-style retail dataset. The goal was to understand overall sales performance, customer behaviour, and how different product categories and outlet types contribute to revenue.

Overview
The dashboard shows key sales metrics such as total sales, average sale value, number of items sold, and average rating. It also breaks down performance based on fat content, item types, outlet tiers, and outlet locations. The visuals are fully interactive and allow filtering across different categories and years.

Purpose of the Project
The main idea behind this dashboard is to analyze which products and outlets contribute the most to overall sales, how customer ratings vary, and what type of items perform best. This project helped me practice data cleaning, creating measures in DAX, designing a structured layout, and building a dashboard that presents business insights clearly.
